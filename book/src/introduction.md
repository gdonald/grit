# Introduction

Welcome to the **Grit Language Guide**. Grit is a lightweight scripting language that transpiles to Rust. The guide is generated from Markdown sources using [mdBook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/), so every update in the repository can be published as a website automatically.

This book covers:

- the language goals and current feature set,
- the internals of tokenization, parsing, and code generation,
- examples you can run locally or compile to Rust,
- tooling guidance for contributors.

Use the navigation panel on the left to jump between chapters, or continue to the next section for a hands-on language tour.
